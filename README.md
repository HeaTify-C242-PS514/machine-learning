# HearTify, Heart Health classify

Welcome to the **HearTify** GitHub Organization! This organization is dedicated to building a heart health classification model and deploying it using cloud computing, machine learning, and mobile development.

## Overview
The **HearTify** project aims to classify heart health conditions based on various lifestyle and health-related features, using machine learning techniques. Our goal is to build a predictive model to categorize heart health into three conditions: `Very Good`, `Good`, and `Poor`.

### Learning Paths Involved:
- **Machine Learning**: Building, training, and evaluating the heart health classification model.
- **Cloud Computing**: Deploying the model on the cloud and setting up infrastructure for scalability and performance.
- **Mobile Development**: Creating an Android application that communicates with the cloud API to present results to end users.

## Repository Structure
Our organization is divided into multiple repositories to organize the different components of the project:
1. **cloud-computing**: Contains the infrastructure and deployment code using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and other cloud services.
2. **machine-learning**: Contains the dataset, data preprocessing code, model building scripts, and model training pipeline.
3. **mobile-development**: Contains the Android application that interacts with the cloud API to display heart health results.

## Project Workflow
The project follows an agile methodology with regular sprints. Hereâ€™s how we approach our tasks:
1. **Sprint Planning**: Tasks are assigned based on priorities and deadlines.
2. **Development**: Team members work on different parts of the project (Cloud, ML, Mobile).
3. **Review**: Pull requests are reviewed by peers.
4. **Deployment**: After successful testing, models and applications are deployed to the cloud.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used includes the following features:
- **Heart_Health (Target):** Heart health conditions (`Very Good`, `Good`, `Poor`).
- **Feature:**
  - `Exercise`
  - `Heart_Disease`
  - `Sex`
  - `BMI`
  - `Smoking_History`
  - `Alcohol_Consumption`
  - `Fruit_Consumption`
  - `Green_Vegetables_Consumption`
  - `FriedPotato_Consumption`
